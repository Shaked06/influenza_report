The primary focus of this analysis is to determine whether people's perceptions of vaccinations have changed as a result of the pandemic. Specifically, has the emergence of Covid-19 led to an increased awareness of health importance, particularly regarding influenza? Alternatively, could the impact be the opposite?

I believe that certain key factors, such as gender, religious beliefs, and age, have independently influenced individuals who are hesitant about getting vaccinated. Nevertheless, the presence of Covid-19 is altering people's views about vaccinations, and this shift is likely to be reflected in this year's flu patient statistics.

In this data exploration, my goal is to examine these assumptions. Later on, I plan to utilize Logistic Regression and assess the significance of various features, including references, in order to validate these notions.

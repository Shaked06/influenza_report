# Influenza report 
The main question of this analysis is to see if there is a change of people's assumptions <br/>
about vaccinations because of the pandemic. <br/>
Is Covid-19 raised people's awareness about the importance of their health and particularly is influenza get more attention now? <br/>
or maybe is the other way around?<br/>
I belive there are some fundementl and independent key factors like gender, religion belive and age  <br/>
who caused a person not to want to vaccinate. Yet, Covid 19 is changing people's perceptions about vaccination <br/>
and this effect will be seen in the rate of this year flu patients.<br/>
In this data exploration I'll check my assumptions and <br/>
later on I'll run Logistic Regression and features importance (and REF) to verify it.

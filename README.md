# Influenza report 
The main question of this anlysis is to see if there is a change of people's assumptions <br/>
about vaccinations because of the pandemic. Is Covid-19 raised people's awareness about the important <br/>
of their health and particularly about influenza? or maybe it does the other way around?<br/>
I belive there are some key factors like gender, religion belive and age <br/>
who caused a person not to want to vaccinate,<br/>
Yet Covid 19 is changing people's perceptions about vaccination and this effect <br/>
will be seen in the rate of thisyear flu patients.<br/>
In this data exploration I'll check my assumptions and <br/>
later I'll run Logistic Regression and features importance (and REF) to verify it.

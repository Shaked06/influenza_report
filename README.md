The main question of this anlysis is to see if there is a change of people's assumptions about vaccinations because of the pandemic. 
Is Covid-19 raised people's awareness about the important of their health and particularly about influenza? or maybe it does the other way around?
I belive there are some key factors like gender, religion belive and age who caused a person not to want to vaccinate,
Yet Covid 19 is changing people's perceptions about vaccination and this effect will be seen in the rate of thisyear flu patients.
In this data exploration I'll check my assumptions and later I'll run Logistic Regression and features importance (and REF) to verify it.
